# DealGapIQ — App Launch & Growth Runbook

**Scope:** What to do *after* the three net-new builds are complete and the launch blockers are resolved. Each step has a concrete action and a verification check so you can run it end-to-end without guesswork.

**The three builds (done):**

1. In-app review prompt — fires at the first verdict (native only).
2. Apple Smart App Banner — iOS Safari web banner, env-driven.
3. "Get the App" button + `/get-app` funnel page.

**The blockers (must be resolved before starting):**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_APP_ID` set in Vercel (activates the smart banner + iOS install link).
- `npx cap sync` run and new iOS/Android builds produced (activates the review plugin).
- Pricing made consistent everywhere — production is **$34.99/mo, $349.99/yr**.

---

## Phase 0 — Pre-Flight Verification (30 min)

Confirm the foundation is solid before anything ships.

- [ ] **Pricing is consistent.** Confirm $34.99 / $349.99 in App Store Connect, Play Console, Stripe, RevenueCat, and marketing copy. *Verify:* no reference to $39.99 remains.
- [ ] **Apple App ID is live in Vercel.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_APP_ID` is set in Production env. *Verify:* after deploy, view-source on `dealgapiq.com` shows `<meta name="apple-itunes-app" content="app-id=...">`.
- [ ] **Native builds include the review plugin.** `npx cap sync` ran clean for both platforms. *Verify:* `frontend/ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift` (this project uses Swift Package Manager, not CocoaPods) and `frontend/android/capacitor.settings.gradle` both reference `in-app-review`.
- [ ] **Quality gates green.** *Verify:* `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run theme:check`, `npm run build` all pass in `frontend/`.
- [ ] **Analytics events fire.** *Verify:* in PostHog you can see `verdict_viewed`, `get_app_clicked`, and (on a native build) `review_prompt_requested`.

---

## Phase 1 — Ship the Web Funnel (Day 1)

These go live the moment you deploy — no app store review needed.

- [ ] **Deploy `frontend/` to Vercel Production.** *Verify:* `/get-app` loads and shows the install card on desktop.
- [ ] **Test the smart banner on a real iPhone (Safari).** Visit `dealgapiq.com`. *Verify:* the native "Get / Open" banner appears at the top.
- [ ] **Test `/get-app` redirects.** Open on iPhone → App Store; on Android → Play Store; on desktop → both buttons. *Verify:* each platform lands on the correct destination.
- [ ] **Place the CTA where traffic lands.** Embed `<GetTheAppButton source="hero" />` in the homepage hero and footer (decide placement; it links to `/get-app`). *Verify:* button visible on web, hidden inside the app.

---

## Phase 2 — Ship the Native Apps (Days 1–3)

- [ ] **iOS:** `npm run cap:open:ios` → Xcode → **Product ▸ Archive** → upload to App Store Connect. *Verify:* build appears in TestFlight.
- [ ] **Android:** open Android Studio → build a **signed AAB** → upload to Play Console internal testing. *Verify:* build appears on the internal track.
- [ ] **Smoke-test on TestFlight + Play internal.** Run one full address → verdict. *Verify:* verdict renders and the app doesn't crash. (Apple's review sheet may not show in test builds — that's expected; it appears in production, throttled by the OS.)
- [ ] **Confirm IAP still works.** Buy/restore the monthly product in the test build. *Verify:* paywall shows real prices and unlocks Pro.

---

## Phase 3 — App Store Optimization Go-Live (Week 1)

Publish the conversion-optimized listing from the marketing plan.

- [ ] **Title / Subtitle (Apple):** `DealGapIQ: Property Analysis` / `Score any deal in 60 seconds`. *Verify:* each ≤ 30 chars.
- [ ] **Keyword field (Apple, 100 chars):** `rental,flip,brrrr,realestate,investor,roi,cashflow,cap,rate,arv,comps,wholesale,proforma,landlord`. *Verify:* no spaces after commas; no words repeated from the title.
- [ ] **Play title + short description:** `DealGapIQ: Property Analysis` / `Score any rental, flip, or BRRRR deal in 60 seconds. See the Deal Gap instantly.` *Verify:* short description ≤ 80 chars.
- [ ] **Play long description:** publish the keyword-weighted draft (Deal Gap → six strategies → multi-source IQ Estimate → Point & Scan → offer tools → founder authority → pricing).
- [ ] **Screenshots (6, both stores):** Deal Gap verdict → 60-sec multi-strategy → Point & Scan → multi-source IQ Estimate → seller script → founder trust card. *Verify:* captions in top third, real numbers, dark UI, portrait 9:16.
- [ ] **Submit for review.** *Verify:* status = "Waiting for Review" (Apple) / "In review" (Google).

---

## Phase 4 — Seed Reviews to 20–30 (Weeks 1–4)

Below ~4.0★ or <10 reviews, both paid and organic conversion are capped. Never incentivize — only prompt people who already love it.

- [ ] **Verify the in-app prompt fires** at the first verdict on a production build.
- [ ] **Personally ask the warm base** (founder network, beta users, early Pro subscribers) for an honest review — link straight to the store review page. *Do not* offer rewards.
- [ ] **Velocity target:** 5–8 reviews/week for 4 weeks → 20–30 total. *Verify:* rating ≥ 4.0★ before scaling paid.

---

## Phase 5 — Activate Organic Channels (Week 1, ongoing)

Point the founder's owned reach (LinkedIn, YouTube, podcasts) at the app — the highest-trust, zero-CAC channel.

- [ ] **Standardize the CTA** on every channel: *"Score any property in 60 seconds, free — get it at dealgapiq.com or search 'DealGapIQ' in the App Store."* (Link to `/get-app` on web; the smart banner/redirect handles mobile.)
- [ ] **Add the authority signature** to every bio/first comment: *"Brad Geisen — Founder of Foreclosure.com; built HomePath.com for Fannie Mae and HomeSteps.com for Freddie Mac."*
- [ ] **Publish on cadence:** 3 LinkedIn / 1 YouTube / 1 podcast-or-repurpose per week, each built around a real (anonymized) Deal Gap example.
- [ ] *Verify:* `get_app_clicked` events show inbound traffic from owned channels (use `?utm_source=` links).

---

## Phase 6 — Launch Paid Acquisition (Week 2+, gated)

**Gate:** do not scale paid until new screenshots are live AND rating ≥ 10 reviews / ≥ 4.0★. Run discovery-budget only until then.

- [ ] **Apple Search Ads** (~$45/day total): Brand defense $5, Core discovery $20, Competitor conquesting $10, Search Match $10. Use a Custom Product Page with the Deal-Gap-led screenshot. *Verify:* CPI tracked per keyword.
- [ ] **Google App Campaign** ($25/day): supply 5 headlines, 5 descriptions, 6 screenshots, 1 portrait video, the icon. Switch bid goal to "first analysis completed" after ~30 installs. *Verify:* assets approved, campaign serving.
- [ ] **Apply guardrails:** pause any keyword > $8 CPI or > $60 cost-per-trial at the 7-day read; reallocate to winners.

---

## Phase 7 — Track & Optimize (Weekly, ongoing)

### KPI dashboard

| Metric | Source | 90-day target |
|---|---|---|
| Product page CVR (view→install) | ASC / Play Console | ≥ 35% (Apple), ≥ 25% (Play) |
| Paid CPI | ASA / Google Ads | ≤ $5 |
| Cost per trial-start | PostHog + ad spend | ≤ $40 |
| Avg rating ★ | ASC / Play | ≥ 4.3 |
| Review count | ASC / Play | 20–30 by day 30 |
| Web→store click CVR | PostHog (`get_app_clicked`) | ≥ 8% of mobile web |
| Install→first analysis | PostHog (`verdict_viewed`) | ≥ 60% |
| Trial→paid conversion | RevenueCat | ≥ 25% |

### Weekly loop (every Monday, 30 min)

1. **Pull:** impressions, taps, CVR, CPI, cost-per-trial by keyword/asset.
2. **Cut:** pause anything over the CPI guardrail or CVR < 2% after 1,000 impressions.
3. **Scale:** +20% budget on keywords with CPI < $5 and trial-start CVR above median.
4. **Test:** one creative change per week (one screenshot *or* one headline — never both).
5. **Promote:** ASA Search-Match and Google broad winners → dedicated exact campaigns.
6. **Read reviews:** mine user language → feed it back into captions and the Play description.

## The One Thing That Matters Most

Fix what 100% of store visitors see — a **Deal-Gap-led title, subtitle, and first two screenshots** — and seed **20–30 honest reviews** before you scale paid. Everything else compounds off those two moves.
